# Marketplace Aggregator (SearchTest)

Minimal Next.js proof-of-concept for aggregating listings from multiple marketplaces.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Project layout

- `src/` — application code (pages, components, lib, styles, data)
- `research/` — findings, samples, plans, tools (archival and reference material)
- `tests/` — integration and debug scripts
- `SPEC.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` — core project documentation

Notes

- Large HTML samples are stored under `research/SAMPLES/` and are gitignored.
- Next.js automatically recognizes `src/pages/`; no further config required for routing.

If you want, I can run the dev server (or try a build) next — Windows PowerShell may require changing execution policy to run global npm scripts.
